//#1 change this function into a ternary and assign it to variable called experiencePoints
function experiencePoints() {
    if (winBattle()) {
        return 10;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

var experiencePoints = winBattle() ? 10 : 1;


//Using this function, answer the questions below:
function moveCommand(direction) { 
    var whatHappens;
    switch (direction) {
        case "forward":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you encounter a monster";
        case "back":
            whatHappens = "you arrived home";
            break;
            break;
        case "right":
            return whatHappens = "you found a river";
            break;
        case "left":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you run into a troll";
            break;
        default:
            whatHappens = "please enter a valid direction";
    }
    return whatHappens;
}

//#2 return value when moveCommant("forward");

//#3 return value when moveCommant("back");

//#4 return value when moveCommant("right");

//#5 return value when moveCommant("left");

//BONUS: practice makes perfect. Go and write your own switch function. It takes time to get used to the syntax!

#2 return value is undefined 
#3 return value is "you arrived home"
#4 return value is "you found a river"
#5 return value is undefined

BONUS:

function moodToday(mood) {
    switch (mood) {
        case "happy":
            return "You are smiling today!";
        case "sad":
            return "Cheer up, it gets better.";
        case "angry":
            return "Take a deep breath.";
        default:
            return "Mood unknown.";
    }
}

console.log(moodToday("happy")); // "You are smiling today!"
